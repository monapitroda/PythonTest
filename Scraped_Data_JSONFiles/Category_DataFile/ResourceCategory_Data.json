Any good leader would promote that level of targeted investment of time and energy.

When all the stars align, stratospheric heights can be achieved in relatively short periods of time. If your brand is growing, and at a blindingly fast speed, then so is the Owner\u2019s risk. Risk management isn\u2019t at the forefront of the franchisors\u2019 mind, especially when it comes to early stage franchises. For so many reasons, insurance takes a back seat.

The lawyers found the brand to be responsible for the claim in the amount of 5M. Yikes! This story is a recurring theme in our industry. The problem is unintentional exposure that puts the brand at risk. Franchisees with even the best intentions struggle with covering their business, let alone being FDD compliant. Franchisors are desperate for a real franchise solution.",

As the most experienced and multi-skilled industry advisory firm, we assist in optimizing the financial performance of clients\u2019 businesses, position clients to maximize the value of their businesses, while guiding our clients and managing the complex transactions to help achieve clients\u2019 goals. Our long-term clients include multi-unit franchisees, franchisors, independent brands, family businesses, large corporations, investors, lenders, private equity investors and family offices.",

                        "Even though the calendar has turned to 2024, many of the obstacles franchisees faced in the challenging deal environment of 2023 are still present. Potential buyers continue to be discouraged by rising costs, restricted access to capital, and elevated interest rates. Franchisees considering a sale must seriously contemplate if this is the right time to sell their franchised units.",
                        "For companies that cannot wait for the macro-economic environment to improve, our advice is to get organized and proactive. Financial records, contracts, leases, and other financial documents must be in order. Know the challenges or weaknesses of the business and be prepared to offer options or solutions.",
                        "Valuations will be lower than in previous years, and a transaction\u2019s momentum will suffer if the buyer encounters unexpected difficulties or surprises during due diligence. In some cases, a quality of earnings (QofE) report may be helpful, with most independent brand transactions requiring one. Proactively completing a QofE report before going to market will often mitigate a purchase price adjustment or re-trade and accelerate the deal timetable.",
                        "As part of the transaction, sellers should clearly outline planned and required future capital projects. For networks that have received deferrals or extensions on development or remodeling, the cost, timing, and scope of work should be detailed. In most cases, deferred maintenance and remodels that have not been completed will be a shared cost between buyer and seller. Projections that include proven sales increases have a greater likelihood of acceptance by a buyer.",
                        "Details on historical sales improvements will also provide the buyer comfort that they are sustainable and not a one-time occurrence. Positive sales and EBITDA momentum is essential when selling in a challenging economic environment. If you don\u2019t have a definite logical buyer, hire an advisory firm to manage the sale, minimizing distractions with the process while adding value and allowing the seller to focus on maintaining the performance of the business.",
                        "With rapidly changing costs, interest rate swings, global political developments, and government intervention in franchising, completing transactions on an accelerated timeline has never been more important. Uncertainty and the abovementioned factors are contributing to more situations for something to go wrong than at any time in recent memory.",
                        "To keep transactions on track, sellers should focus on preparation and relations with contracted parties. Solid relations and communication with landlords can save days or weeks in the closing process in terms of receiving timely consents and lease assignments. Open dialogue in terms of transaction timing can also minimize last-minute demands from landlords. Advanced communication with counsel to prepare initial forms of LOIs, purchase agreements, and other documents also can save sellers time.",
                        "A wide gap in valuation expectations persists between sellers and buyers. Many sellers, especially those in the QSR space with drive-thrus, experienced strong financial results in 2020 and 2021 and continue to think they can sell based on those results. Buyers, however, are factoring in an additional 6 months of margin compression because of increases in commodities and labor costs.",
                        "Thus, sellers contemplating deals today must be prepared to get creative to bridge the gap. With traditional capital sources constrained, to get deals done both buyers and sellers should review alternatives such as seller financing, non-bank lenders, earnouts, and rollover minority equity positions. We expect the valuation gap to remain unbalanced until margin pressures and interest rates are more predictable.",
                        "While private equity can be a solution for franchises, especially in larger, established tier-one brands, most PE firms concentrate on owning brands, not on being a franchisee.",
                        "PE firms, family offices, and other institutional capital will continue to selectively pursue new franchisee opportunities. In limited cases, turning to one of these investors may be the best option for franchisees, especially in growing, independent brands with scale. Family offices can be a better fit for franchisees as they often have a longer-term investment horizon with flexibility to invest in real estate as well as in operating businesses. PE firms generally have a defined investment horizon and are not interested in real estate.",
                        "However, many brands are not interested in PE investments in their system. Before embarking on a sale to a PE firm, it is best to understand your brand\u2019s thoughts on institutional capital. Brands vary on this issue; some restrict PE investments while others are more open to the idea.",
                        "Selling to a PE firm or family office also can be an option for operators who may want to continue to be involved in the business without the pressure of full control. Often PE firms bring industry experience, back-office resources, and technology that can improve profitability. Synergies may be present in their existing portfolio, especially if the PE firm is a proven consolidator. Franchisees looking to partner with a PE firm must be prepared to have a laser focus on growth and investment returns.",
                        "Franchisees that are successful dealmakers must adapt to different and evolving criteria as deal conditions remain less certain and fluid. Be patient, flexible, and look for fair solutions that can satisfy both parties. The deal environment is expected to be unpredictable for the foreseeable future, so consider adjusting your expectations to improve your chances of success.",

Following this encounter, Cabinet IQ successfully concluded their six-month-long quest for a suitable CRM solution. Having experienced disappointment with three previous CRM options, primarily due to integration conflicts, inadequate scheduling features, and the unmanageable use of five different solutions, Cabinet IQ had identified precisely what they sought in a CRM. Their previous frustrations with other vendors had equipped them with a checklist of requirements that we were able to fulfill!",

                        "Despite having a well-defined vision of the necessary features, as an emerging brand, they were pleasantly surprised that ServiceMinder applied industry insights as a strategic partner rather than just another vendor. In November of 2022, Cabinet IQ officially partnered with ServiceMinder. With ServiceMinder\u2019s comprehensive approach, Cabinet IQ transitioned from managing daily operations across five distinct platforms to a single, unified solution. After thorough training and workflow configuration, all locations were launched by August 2023. Less than a year into their ServiceMinder journey, Cabinet IQ launched two new locations.",

Historically, franchise laws have focused on requiring affirmative disclosures by franchisors so that franchisee prospects can obtain information about the franchise system to better understand the business opportunity that they are evaluating. While the vast majority of franchise registration states require franchisors to submit information about their third-party brokers in franchise seller disclosure forms, only two (New York and Washington), have historically required brokers to register themselves with the state.",
                        "If passed, Bill 919 would require third-party franchise sellers, colloquially known as franchise brokers, to register with the State of California. The fee for a franchise seller filing an initial registration application is $250, with a $150 annual renewal fee and $50 fee to amend a registration upon a material change to the application information. More notably, Bill 919 goes above and beyond the registration requirement, which is also found in New York and Washington law, by adding a disclosure component.",
                        "Under Bill 919, franchise brokers would be required to disclose some of the information that is traditionally provided by franchisors in their Franchise Disclosure Document (\u201cFDD\u201d).\u00a0 Specifically, brokers must submit a Uniform Third-Party Franchise Seller Disclosure Form and a Uniform Third-Party Franchise Seller Disclosure Document (\u201cFSDD\u201d) along with their registration application. In addition to registering the FSDD with the state, franchise sellers must also present this document to a prospective franchisee prior to engaging with them about a franchise opportunity.",
                        "The FSDD must include the following information:",
                        "While not nearly as extensive as the FDD\u2019s disclosure obligations, Bill 919\u2019s FSDD tracks some of the types of items that must also be disclosed by franchisors, such as litigation history and fee structure.",
                        "With respect to enforcement, Bill 919 creates a cause of action that allows franchisees to sue for damages and rescission if the seller violates the law with respect to a franchise sale. Additionally, the California commissioner can issue a stop order prohibiting a franchise seller from offering or selling franchises in the state if it finds that a seller has failed to comply with any applicable provisions of law or rules issued by the commissioner.",
                        "The bill is not limited to sellers located in the State of California. The new rules and penalties will also to any scenario\u00a0when a prospective franchisee is a resident of California, has its principal place of business in California, or if the franchised business is located in California; this essentially extends the scope of Bill 919 to any franchise broker that wishes to sell franchises that will be located in California or sell franchises to prospects located in California.",
                        "Furthermore, as none of the mandatory disclosure items are limited to California sellers or California franchisees, it appears that Bill 919 may have a secondary purpose of creating a template for the regulation of franchise sellers on a nationwide level. Coupled with the fact that the International Franchise Association assisted in crafting this bill, we view Bill 919 as a bellwether of more regulation to come, either from additional registration states acting individually or through the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA). Sponsored by Senator Tom Umberg, Bill 919 is being considered by the Rules Committee and would go into effect July 1, 2025.",

                        "In the ever-evolving digital landscape of 2024, the importance of a franchise\u2019s website cannot be overstated. As the cornerstone of your Digital Activation Strategy (DAS) i.e. listings, review, social, paid, direct mail \u2013 to name a few, your website is not just a tool, but the heart of your online presence, the source of truth for customers and the digital front door for local marketing. Its role extends beyond being a mere digital brochure as might make you believe; it\u2019s a dynamic platform that drives SEO, generates leads, and ultimately, contributes significantly to your franchisees\u2019 revenue.",
                        "Imagine your website as the central hub in a wheel, with every spoke representing different digital tools and platforms, from AI-driven solutions to online directories. It\u2019s the foundation that supports and connects these technologies. In this context, a website that merely \u201cchecks the box,\u201d as our CEO likes to say \u2013 is a missed opportunity. The goal is to create a solid foundation site that doesn\u2019t just \u201ccheck the box\u201d but rather, sets new standards for agencies ensuring core web vitals are met, new pages can be added at a moment\u2019s notice, a site can be launched for the new franchisee in minutes, and that budgets for advertising are being accounted for with new leads.",
                        "The future of SEO will be significantly influenced by Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE), an AI-powered search technology that\u2019s reshaping the way users interact with search engines and how digital marketers approach SEO.",
                        "At\u00a0a recent conference\u00a0attended\u00a0by our CEO, an insightful concept was shared, emphasizing the efficiency of information that a brand already has access to; highlighting that merely 10% of a brand\u2019s information can potentially address 80% of customer inquiries. This statistic underscores the importance of strategically organizing and presenting information, in a format easily read and sourced by LLMs (either in-house or through tools like ChatGPT or Google Bard)",
                        "Having your structured content aligned with current conversational search trends not only makes information more accessible to customers but also caters to the evolving nature of search engine queries. Leveraging tools such as Semrush\u2019s\u00a0Keyword Magic Tool\u00a0can be instrumental in this process. This tool helps in identifying prevalent questions and long-tail queries relevant to your business domain, allowing you to tailor your content to meet specific customer needs and search patterns. By focusing on creating content that addresses these targeted queries, you can enhance the relevance and visibility of your brand\u2019s online presence.",
                        "While the roll-out of Google SGE (currently in beta) will mark a significant shift in SEO strategies, brands and their chosen platform and/or\u00a0SEO professionals need to adapt by focusing on quality, informative content and aligning with the evolving user search behaviors driven by AI technologies like SGE and ChatGPT. The goal is to balance between optimizing for search engines and fulfilling user intent more effectively.",
                        "Often, marketing agencies bundle website development with other DAS services, such as paid advertising. This approach can lead to websites being treated as an afterthought. In contrast, separating each component of your DAS allows for integrating the best marketing technologies, tailored to each specific need.",
                        "Today, if you need to spin up an additional page or 40 for franchisees to offer a new service \u2013 how long would that take to execute? A day? Week? Month? Three? The opportunity may already have passed, such as the seasonality of hanging holiday lights or a specific type of pest for an exterminator.",
                        "In the local marketing category of MarTech (marketing technology) startups are clamoring to add more products to their solutions to add more revenue to appease investors vs. customers. Whether you are 20 locations or 1,000 \u2013 everyone gets the same platform. No two businesses have the exact marketing tech stack, so while a lower price may seem appealing, you have to ask \u2013 what is missing that our franchisees really need today, tomorrow, and beyond?",
                        "Many agencies outsource website development, using white-labeled third-party services. This not only adds unnecessary costs but also complicates communication and collaboration, requiring an unwieldy amount of trust in multiple parties to work efficiently without significant oversight.",
                        "Additionally, if your agency is running your paid search \u2013 they most likely are taking a fee \u2013 typically between 10 \u2013 20% of your spend. So while your franchisees are shelling out $1000 only $800 is going to actual advertising \u2013 that could be an additional 6 \u2013 12 new customers that are not seeing or choosing your franchisee.",
                        "Staying current with Google guidelines and core web vitals is crucial for maintaining your site\u2019s relevance and effectiveness. Additionally, compliance with standards like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is not just a legal imperative but also a moral one. Failing to keep up can have significant repercussions.",
                        "Consumer behavior is in a constant state of flux. The rise of mobile-first designs, user interfaces (UIs) focused on personalization, and localization are trends that can\u2019t be ignored. While agencies can manage these changes, dedicated website vendors, who specialize exclusively in website development, are more likely to be proactive and efficient in implementing these updates.",
                        "In conclusion, for franchise brands looking to radically change their approach and thrive in 2024 and beyond, it\u2019s essential to keep franchisee websites independent from all-in-one platforms and agencies. By doing so, they can leverage the most effective marketing technologies, avoid unnecessary costs, ensure timely updates, and meet the evolving demands of consumers. An independent, well-maintained, and strategically developed website is not just a part of your digital strategy\u2014it\u2019s the linchpin of your franchisees\u2019 success.\u00a0Click here\u00a0to learn more about making the most of your franchise website in 2024.",

As an operator, Michael\u2019s day-to-day is all about taking care of the behind-the-scenes operations that keep the business growing.",

Finding the perfect site involved multiple factors, including outdoor space for multiple dogs, proximity to habitual locations for his customers (like fast food joints and coffee shops), and demographics like high annual income. But while Michael\u2019s commercial realtor provides sites, Michael likes to dig into the advanced data behind them himself to reduce the back and forth\u2014which is why he went looking for a tool he could start using quickly with no learning curve.",

We need data where it\u2019s quick and usable.\u201d",

It\u2019s taking over many areas of business and entertainment, and as the technology continues to innovate, the benefits for your business will grow even larger. What can AI do for you and your franchise business? Franchise Supplier Network partner Ryan Hicks recently spoke about AI at UnConference, a conversation we\u2019ll be continuing at Franchise Young Conference. Here are some of the highlights:",
                        "What is AI?",
                        "Artificial intelligence, or AI, combines large sets of data and massive computing power to identify patterns and make predictions. Newer versions are able to fully tailor the output to you with conversation history and memory. AI is smart enough to perform tasks that before now, only a human could complete.",
                        "Why should I use AI?",
                        "First and foremost, AI is a huge timesaver. For example, there is generative AI (like ChatGPT) that creates things on a human-like level. This can be used to write copy and is smart enough to even understand the subject, tone, and more. Also, it is free, easy to use, and accessible to everyone on many levels. It can be beneficial for marketing and advertising to help you create content that consumers actually want to see. Lastly, it\u2019s important to stay on top of the technology and societal changes in order to ensure your business is relevant.",
                        "What are the drawbacks?",
                        "No, AI robots will not be taking over the world, but there are some important aspects to be aware of. Some platforms have outdated information and do not have knowledge past a certain year. It\u2019s also important to note that free versions will be more simple than versions you have to pay for.",
                        "How can it benefit my franchise?",
                        "As you input information, the AI learns and improves. With each task, it understands better and will get closer and closer to perfect. It acts as an all-encompassing, gold-star employee by saving time, creating content, and organizing information. In a business like franchising, where everything needs to be mass-communicated and implemented, AI brings an exciting new opportunity to automate and improve standard systems for your marketing, operations, recruiting, and in nearly every other area of your business.",

                        "As companies are increasingly confronted with the new frontier of technological innovation, they will also need to integrate these tools within their workflows to remain competitive with their clientele. dbSeer is the partner you want to guide you in learning through practice, as practice makes perfect. Currently, companies have a real need to align the promises of advanced technology with their real-world, practical applications.",
                        "Case Study: Leveraging A.I. to Keep Your Customers Happy",
                        "In a recent project with a B2C client, dbSeer harnessed the power of automation and artificial intelligence to revolutionize their operations. Automation and A.I. can significantly enhance productivity and streamline processes \u2013 if you understand how best to use it.",
                        "When looking at their needs, we assessed that their Google Review management was a process that could be automated. Managing a growing number of reviews can be an overwhelming task for businesses. And yet, businesses that respond to just a single customer review earn 4% more revenue on average. However, 75% of businesses choose to not respond to their reviews. This is largely due to the time that it takes to respond, and other issues taking priority. Automation, however, can offer an effective solution to this problem.",
                        "With the right tools, companies can now not only assess sentiment, but also craft personalized responses that aren\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach, all while remarkably reducing the time it takes.",
                        "In our case, to efficiently manage this feedback, dbSeer developed a script powered by A.I. This script not only scanned through the reviews but also generated appropriate responses. To help improve the A.I.\u2019s performance, our team categorized responses as positive or negative and even identified potential issues, such as pricing concerns or opportunities for additional product offerings to help further advance the responses and feedback. We then provided a sample to A.I. for further automated responses.",
                        "Our team successfully processed 500 Google reviews, gaining valuable insights to help move our client forward. As an example, A.I. discerned that one review was made during a particularly cold November. This insight allowed us to craft a response that demonstrated our commitment to customer satisfaction during this season: truly providing a very personalized response to a cherished customer.",
                        "Return on Investment",
                        "Online reputation is everything and the first thing a customer looks at is online reviews. 91% of 18- to 34-year-olds trust reviews online as much as personal recommendations \u2013 this clearly means that the importance managing these reviews should not be underestimated.",
                        "According to one survey, 60% of consumers feel that the number of reviews a business has is a key indicator of whether or not they will use their services. The more, the better.",
                        "But your employees shouldn\u2019t spend their entire workday on customer reviews. A.I. and automation are critical to streamline this process. And by tracking metrics like customer retention, an increase in positive reviews (or reviews overall), and other key performance indicators, companies can gauge the value of automation in this process. Just the time saved by using this technology should be a measure of success!",

Automation\u2019s role isn\u2019t to replace human interactions but to enhance them. It streamlines processes, making them more efficient for customers, and employees alike: allowing for more \u2018human work\u2019 to be performed.",

The funds raised are earmarked almost entirely for sales and marketing program creation for revenue growth acceleration. Additionally, Woven has been implemented at more than 35% of all\u00a0Planet Fitness\u00a0clubs, 60% of all Buff City Soap locations, other brands such as\u00a0Pet Supplies Plus\u00a0and\u00a0Great Clips, and across entire brand footprints, like\u00a0Massage Heights\u00a0and\u00a0Zips Car Wash.",

                        "Franchise brands and operators today are facing new challenges related to inflation and increases in commodity costs, staffing issues, strained supply chains limiting the availability of certain products, and construction challenges related to the price of raw materials and the availability of labor and equipment needed to meet new development and remodel goals.",
                        "Given these challenges, franchisor and franchisee relations have also continued to evolve. Brands have become more selective in approving new franchisees and are more involved in franchisee-to-franchisee transfers and acquisitions. To continue to grow in the franchise space, it is important for franchisees to review their growth plans and strategies to ensure alignment with franchisor goals and objectives.",
                        "Successful growth within brands depends on a strong and healthy relationship between franchisors and franchisees. As more franchisees expand and diversify into multiple concepts, franchisor-franchisee relationships become more complicated. To foster a working relationship that is a win-win for all parties, it is important for franchisees to understand each franchisor\u2019s goals, priorities, and concerns.",
                        "The performance of specific brands has deviated significantly throughout the pandemic. Different brands have different focuses, and franchisee growth strategies should be tailored to best align with the current objectives of each franchisor. Alignment between each brand\u2019s priorities and goals and franchisee support for those goals is critical to a successful relationship.",
                        "As an example, many top-performing brands would likely respond more favorably to a franchisee looking to consolidate and acquire more units if that franchisee was also committed to future growth and development and reinvestment in their current portfolio. On the other hand, a challenged brand may be more supportive of a franchisee willing to acquire and turn around underperforming locations, putting that franchisee first in line for additional acquisition opportunities that arise. Brands are more willing to support franchisees who are willing to assist them in solving problems or are willing to become early adopters of brand initiatives, including remodeling and other key projects.",
                        "Be transparent in their communication with franchisors on their growth plans, accomplishments, and financial strength. Many franchisees assume the franchisor is aware of everything transpiring in their businesses. As brands have streamlined internal support and G&A budgets have been cut, franchisors simply do not have the resources to track the activity of individual franchisees at the same level as in years past.",
                        "Provide periodic updates on new development, remodeling, and their progress on other initiatives. This will ensure the brand is aware of a franchisee\u2019s accomplishments, as well as any challenges they may come across.",
                        "Plan a periodic face-to-face meeting with brand leadership to reinforce their financial capabilities, capital resources, and growth plans. These meetings can also serve as an opportunity for franchisees to position themselves as a resource and steward for the brand.",
                        "Get involved with brand committees, advisory boards, and other groups focused on various aspects of the franchise business. Franchisee advisory committees often have more exposure to high-level executives and key members of a brand\u2019s management team. Additionally, these committees allow franchisees to share best practices and learn from other high-profile and influential franchisees on how to better run and manage their businesses. The more visible a franchisee is to a brand and its leadership team, the more opportunities that operator will have to showcase their strengths and accomplishments to improve and gain additional support and favor with the brand.",
                        "The relationship between franchisors and franchisees is continuously changing. The days of growing your franchise business without support and involvement from the franchisor are over. The most successful growth-oriented franchisees today are embracing interaction with the brand and supporting brand initiatives relating to discounting and promotions, new marketing campaigns, product tests, and reinvestment. Those most successful at increasing their respective profiles are able to gain easier brand support and approval on future acquisitions, and may even see additional acquisition opportunities steered their way.",
                        "Our advice for growth-oriented franchisees is to develop a strong working relationship with your franchisors, and to come up with a plan to continue to enhance and improve those relationships. Let your franchisor know your goals and objectives, because without brand support, growth can be infinitely more difficult and unpredictable. As franchisors continue to exert increasing influence on the direction and growth of their franchise systems, it has never been more important to embrace the new norms of franchisor-franchisee relations.",

John Marsh has been incredibly professional and has stayed in touch throughout the process. He always takes my calls and responds to emails promptly. I have already recommended Purple Penguin Digital to other small business owners, and I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking to build their business.\u201d \u2013 Christina H., Franchise Owner",

AI solutions are also able to provide ideas and automated scripts for agents to use if they need them. In certain cases, using AI for training reduced onboarding time by 30%.",

Managing a growing number of reviews can be an overwhelming task for businesses. And yet, businesses that respond to just a single customer review earn 4% more revenue on average, making it a clear priority for return on investment.",

For example, for one of the comments, our AI model discerned that a review was made during a particularly cold November. This insight allowed us to craft a response that demonstrated our commitment to customer satisfaction during this season: truly providing a very personalized response to a cherished customer.",

                        "Awarity is an AI-powered advertising platform that helps brands reach their ideal customers more efficiently than other forms of awareness advertising, driving industry-leading ROI.",
                        "As viewership has shifted to Connected TV, so have many advertisers. Learn how traditional and Connected TV advertising work to evaluate the right choice for your franchise.",
                        "With the rise of streaming TV, more and more consumers have made the switch from cable to Connected TV, driving advertisers to shift towards these platforms to reach them. However, traditional TV advertising still plays a role in the marketing strategies of many brands. Developing an understanding of how both forms of media work is critical for any franchisor or franchisee looking to utilize TV advertising.",
                        "So how does TV advertising work? Let\u2019s review some of the basics behind how traditional and Connected TV advertising work and how they stack up against each other so you can determine the best choice for your brand.",
                        "Traditional TV advertising can require a considerable amount of planning, budgeting, and research to get started. To run commercials on traditional TV, advertisers buy ad space during a specific program and specific time slot depending on their target audience. For example, a brand looking to reach working moms may buy ad space in late night TV time slots on reality TV programming with high female viewership rates.",
                        "Connected TV advertising campaigns are significantly easier to get started. Connected TV reaches a more targeted audience than Traditional TV, as brands can choose specific audiences to reach on whatever program they\u2019re watching. For example, the same brand looking to reach working moms could target that audience using behavioral and demographic tactics and serve commercials to them on any program, app, or channel they\u2019re watching.",
                        "Reporting and Measurement:\u00a0Traditional TV\u2019s reporting and metrics are limited, often relying on limited viewership data provided by networks. Alternatively, Connected TV campaigns provide access to real-time data so you can gain insights on the platforms your audience is watching, completion rates, impressions, and more. At Awarity, all Connected TV campaigns include access to Awarity Campaign Central, where you can access granular, real-time reporting.",
                        "Creative Flexibility: Connected TV provides more flexibility to adjust and update your creative. With the ability to manage your own creative, you can easily feature specific promotions or tailor your creative based on the particular audience and individual franchise location. When it comes to Traditional TV, creative adjustments and customizations can be time consuming and require more communication with the networks.",
                        "Pricing and Efficiency:\u00a0At Awarity, our Connected TV campaigns have an avg. CPM of $35.85. While Traditional TV advertising\u2019s CPMs vary by network, daypart, program, and other factors, its lack of targeting and skippable placements results in wasted ad spend and higher costs. When accounting for wasted media, Connected TV\u2019s effective CPM to reach your target customer is much lower than traditional TV\u2019s effective CPM.",
                        "While Connected TV has increased in popularity for its ease of use, targeting capabilities, and reporting, traditional TV can still play a role for larger franchisors and brands looking to reach a broad audience. Understanding how tv advertising works and how different forms of linear and Connected TV can be implemented for the best results in your marketing strategy is a key first step to starting TV advertising.",

This unique platform attracts 75% of all Millenials and Gen Z\u2019ers who have $4.4 TRILLION in global spending power. These 347 million users who are on Snapchat every day are ready to buy! As a franchise brand, if this is your target audience, you can capture this highly engaged, valuable marketplace at a fraction of the cost of Facebook.",

                        "A: Use 5-10 second videos to capture their attention rather than longer videos or still images. This demographic of users like snippets to cater to their short attention spans.",
                        "What\u2019s the best way to retarget them?",
                        "A: Take advantage of SwipeUp Remarketing. Once they\u2019ve swiped on your ad the first\u00a0time, you\u2019ve planted the seed. SwipeUp Remarketing allows you to catch their attention\u00a0further down the funnel.",
                        "How long should my campaign be?",
                        "A: Snapchat uses AI to target your audience. Every time you start a new campaign, it has to relearn the parameters. Therefore, the most effective campaigns are continual. The longer they run, the more data it collects, making them more effective. Simply change the ad sets frequently while keeping the original campaign running.",
                        "Jessica says,\u00a0\u201cAdvertising on Snapchat will cost an average of one-tenth what you\u2019ll pay on Facebook per 1000 impressions. That means you\u2019ll have a much wider reach for the same amount of ad spend.\u201d",

                        "On October 27, 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) published a rule establishing a new standard for determining whether entities will be considered \u201cjoint employers\u201d of a group of employees for collective bargaining purposes. This rule essentially overturns the previous NLRB rule that took effect in April 2020.\u00a0A one-page document summarizing the new rule and the recommended actions for franchise systems can be found\u00a0here.",
                        "While well-intentioned, the new rule threatens a key tenet of the franchising model and creates a number of unintended negative consequences for franchisors, franchisees and consumers. To that end, the International Franchising Association (IFA) and other industry groups submitted comments and requested some sort of carveout or additional clarification to protect the franchise model, but the NLRB declined. Therefore, unless Congress overturns this rule, we will be left with a new standard that is broader and more confusing than the \u201csubstantial direct and immediate control\u201d required under the 2020 rule.",
                        "In short, the franchise relationship is already highly regulated by the federal government, specifically the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as well as by a number of states. This regulatory framework protects franchisees while solidifying their status as independent business owners that operate within a franchise system but are ultimately responsible for the success of their business through their management of employees and day-to-day operations. By introducing a new rule that undeniably increases the chances of determining that a franchisor will be considered the employer of their franchisees and/or their employees, the NLRB has introduced a totally separate and often contradictory lens within which the franchise relationship must be analyzed.",
                        "As described below, the new NLRB rule prevents franchisors from establishing reasonable controls in two critical areas unless they are willing to risk being deemed an employer of their franchisees and/or their employees: (1) ensuring brand uniformity and enforcing minimum system standards, and (2) monitoring and managing franchisee compliance with industry-specific laws, regulations, and licensing requirements.",
                        "Under the 2023 rule, an entity will be deemed to be a joint employer for purposes of collective bargaining if it has authority to control \u201cessential terms and conditions of employment.\u201d One of the positive impacts that came out of the NLRB\u2019s comment period is that the proposed rule was modified to specifically list the seven terms and conditions that meet this threshold and affirmatively stating that the object of control must be tied to one of these seven terms. The seven terms are as follows:",
                        "Of these seven terms, four of them (#1, #2, #3, and #6) represent standard employer functions that should not impact the vast majority of franchise systems unless they are interpreted very liberally by the courts. Another term, the supervision of the performance of duties (#4), should also not pose a major problem unless this impacts a franchisor\u2019s reserved rights to inspect and audit its franchisees, which is critical to ensuring brand standards are met. However, the final two terms and conditions of employment (#5 and #7) pose challenges under the new rule.",
                        "Most franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with brand standards set forth in the franchise agreement and operations manual, which often include requirements related to health and safety. Additionally, the vast majority of franchise agreements require franchisees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including laws related to health and safety, and permit the franchisor to terminate the franchise agreement if these obligations are breached. Under the new rule, these requirements trigger exposure to joint employment determinations, as franchisors are effectively prohibited from indirectly controlling or even reserving the right to control working conditions related to health and safety.",
                        "Through this element, the NLRB has created a framework that harms not only franchise systems but also consumers. Franchisors are often better positioned than their franchisees to understand how to proactively develop policies and operational procedures to minimize health and safety risks to the public. They also have more experience in responding to these types of issues or directing their franchisees how to act, especially in industries (healthcare, service, etc.) with specific requirements above and beyond operating a business generally. By incorporating this broadly worded element in the new rule, Franchisors will be forced to revisit commonly incorporated contractual terms in their franchise agreements and will be reluctant to set operational standards related to health and safety to the detriment of their franchisees and the ultimate consumers.",
                        "Finally, and most importantly, term and condition #5 (work rules and directions governing the manner, means, and methods of the performance of duties and the grounds for discipline) will create significant challenges when applied under the new standard. One of the critical components of every franchise system is the establishment of baseline standards designed to provide the consumer with the desired brand experience. The NLRB\u2019s use of nebulous terms like \u201cmanner, means, and method\u201d jeopardizes this cornerstone element of franchising by creating increased risk of joint employment exposure.",
                        "In fact, the FTC\u2019s Franchise Rule sets forth three definitional elements of a franchise, and one of those is that the franchisor \u201cwill exert or has the authority to exert a significant degree of control over the franchisee\u2019s method of operation, or provide significant assistance in the franchisee\u2019s method of operation.\u201d The FTC therefore recognizes that this element is a natural and essential component of the franchise relationship; however, under the NLRB\u2019s new rule you will be considered a joint employer if you reserve the right to control the manner, means, and methods of how day-to-day job functions are performed. This frustrating contradiction explains why the franchising community voiced strong opposition to this terminology through the issuance of comments in the rule making process, and underscores the conflict between the new rule and existing franchise law.",
                        "The most significant change to the 2020 rule comes not from the list of terms and conditions of employment, but from the fact that a franchisor could be considered a joint employer even if they don\u2019t actually exercise control related to these terms and conditions. Instead, the new standard will look at whether a franchisor has the authority to control the essential terms and conditions of employment (generally through reserved rights in the operations manual or franchise agreement).",
                        "A franchisor tasked with maintaining a uniform system that presents a certain image and level of quality to the public must inherently reserve a number of rights in its franchise agreement that it hopes never to exercise. Similarly, a franchisor\u2019s operations manual must not only establish baseline standards to protect its brand, but also include the ability to take action against franchisees that do not maintain these standards and end up harming the image of the rest of the system. An inability to reserve these rights essentially prevents a franchisor from responding to the types of real-world problems that come up in the operation of nearly every type of business. To contrast, the 2020 rule looked at whether a franchisor exercised substantial direct control, which would be an indicator that a franchisor is actually stepping into the role of an employer by managing day-to-day operations as a regular course of business.",
                        "Additionally, the new standard makes it clear that it applies to both direct and indirect control \u2013 from a franchising perspective, this removes the distinction between whether a franchisor directly controls the franchisee\u2019s employees or whether it does so through the franchisee. While this poses less of a problem than the authority to control analysis described above, franchisors tasked with protecting the brand may have a legitimate need to respond to an isolated health and safety issue or another performance-related issue involving a franchisee\u2019s employee. While such a response should be coordinated in tandem with the franchisee, the franchisor\u2019s actions could still be construed as indirect control.",
                        "For this reason, the 2020 rule specifically excluded control that is \u201conly exercised on a sporadic, isolated, or de minimis basis.\u201d With respect to franchising, this exclusion is entirely appropriate and necessary to ensure that a franchisor has the ability to step in when a serious issue has arisen that threatens the brand or system as a whole. However, this exclusion makes it clear that these types of interventions are reserved for isolated incidents rather than as an ordinary course of business, which correctly addresses the difference between a franchisor protecting their brand and an employer dictating the activities of its employees.",
                        "As noted above, the new NLRB rule fails to address two critical components of a franchise system that are wholly independent from the legal definition of an employer-employee relationship: (1) brand uniformity and minimum system standards, and (2) compliance with industry-specific laws, regulations, and licensing requirements. By making it substantially more difficult for franchisors to protect these components, the new rule creates two possible negative consequences for franchisees.",
                        "While several commenters, including the IFA, noted the importance of franchisors protecting their brands and their marks, it is clear that the NLRB failed to fully grasp the scope of what that entails. The new rule states that \u201cmany forms of control that franchisors reserve to protect their brands or trade service marks (like those dealing with logos, store design, d\u00e9cor, or product uniformity) will typically not be indicative of a common-law employment relationship.\u201d",
                        "By essentially reducing a brand to a color scheme and a logo, the NLRB has ignored some of the most critical components of what makes a franchise system succeed. Yes, the actual mark is what is most visible to the public, but the standards behind that mark are what gives it value and what lets the public know what they can expect when they interact with any franchise in the system. Methods of operation, customer service, and proprietary processes are all components of a franchisor\u2019s brand that they need the right to protect. In some industries, particularly service-focused industries without brick-and-mortar locations, these are arguably the most important components of the system to regulate.",
                        "Instead, the NLRB is now creating a framework where a franchisor could be deemed an employer by reserving rights related to \u201cthe manner, means, and methods of the performance of duties. . .\u201d \u2013 under this standard, protecting the brand will be a greater challenge, harming both the other franchisees that comprise the system as well as the general public.",
                        "Though not as significant, a second area of concern relates to compliance with (often industry-specific) laws, regulations, and minimum licensing requirements. Franchising is a business model that cuts across nearly every industry that comprises the U.S. economy, and many franchisees are entrepreneurs that are first entering a new industry when they buy a franchise. While the vast majority of franchise agreements are structured so that franchisees are ultimately responsible for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, they understandably account for a level of support and guidance from franchisors.",
                        "To that end, it is critical that franchisors be able to step in when there are compliance issues. This is essential for not only protecting the brand as described above, but also for protecting the consumers that are often the intended beneficiaries of these laws and regulations. While some issues do not impact the defined terms and conditions of employment, it is clear that many do (particularly with respect to the methods of performance and health and safety issues). Whether it involves licensed professions in the financial industry or workplace safety issues in the medical or home service industries, many franchisors have a legitimate need to reserve the right to ensure franchisees comply with relevant laws and regulations.",
                        "If the rule takes effect in its current form, franchisors will essentially be stuck between a rock and a hard place. They can either accept the fact that they will be deemed a joint employer for collective bargaining purposes or they can modify their contracts, manuals, and operational practices to ensure that they do not meet the joint employer threshold under the new standard. Both of these would have negative consequences for franchisees.",
                        "If a franchisor accepts its role a joint employer, the logical next step is to dramatically increase the amount of control over franchisee operations to minimize any labor-related issues with its newfound employees. This means less independence for franchisee operators and increased fees to defray what will likely be substantial costs for franchisors. On the other hand, a franchisor that does not wish to be deemed a joint employer will be less willing to provide operational direction, employee handbooks, or educational materials, reducing the level of support that franchisees receive.",
                        "While the NLRB states that it is \u201cmindful that applying the final rule will require sensitivity to industry-specific norms and practices,\u201d the current version of the rule is drafted to avoid this level of nuance and relies on the courts to uniformly apply its broad standard without any additional guidance. For this reason and all of these reasons listed above, Congress should step in and prevent the rule from taking effect in its current iteration in order to avoid substantial harm to the franchising community and its consumers."

Mapping franchise territories is just one of these tasks, and she doesn\u2019t have any time to lose doing it. That\u2019s why she chose Smappen.",

As a serviceminder admin, you can customize geo-zones based on zip code, city, or whatever you can draw out on a map \u2013 literally whatever your heart desires. (well, maybe not whatever, but you get the gist).",
                        "This feature improves productivity by scheduling appointments based on geography so service agents aren\u2019t wasting too much time driving in the vans by crossing major highways driving around landscape elements like rivers, lakes and mountains! If the job or project happens to be outside, you can also measure the property and provide additional info to service agents before they even arrive. This capability ultimately improves client experience by prepping service agents and also saves a brand time and money at scale.",
                        "But wait, there\u2019s more\u2026 you can also send promo emails, direct mail, and local advertisement based on the data provided from using GeoZones-to both prospects and current clients. See a lot of opportunities in a certain GeoZone? Let\u2019s target that area!",
                        "With their comprehensive approach, it\u2019s ServiceMinder\u2019s goal to provide multi-purpose features. Utilizing one ServiceMinder solution solves several challenges for home services brand.",
                        "Another easy way to target clients for additional services or prospects is with Tags.",
                        "As they appreciate that every workflow and home service brand is unique, like GeoZones, Tags are also completely customizable. You can create tags for types of service, lead type, client interests or whatever supports your marketing goals.",
                        "With these Tags, you can create drip campaigns within serviceminder to automatically send an email or text with certain actions or scheduled at specific times to a specific targeted audience. There are many benefits to what we just mentioned, but the keyword is \u2018automatically\u2019. Once campaigns are created, there is no need to worry about chasing a lead or client retention. Your comprehensive CRM has you covered. This handy tool also helps to track client journey and campaign success, which again is all in serviceminder. Be in the know on marketing spend/ROI, popular service types, and more!",
                        "Not to be repetitive, but imagine streamlining all marketing efforts straight from your CRM? We know the term \u201call-in-one\u201d is over-used, but in serviceminder\u2019s case, it\u2019s a perfect way to describe their solution.",

It\u2019s easy to not prioritize conferences & events when you have a million things on your plate, but they can actually help grow your business.

Investing the time in your business is what will actually help your franchise grow and thrive.",

                        "The franchise model remains a beacon of entrepreneurial spirit, merging the safety of a proven business model with the excitement of individual ownership. Yet, as the landscape becomes increasingly competitive, standing out in the franchise market is no small feat. It\u2019s not just about a solid business plan anymore; it\u2019s about how you can enhance franchise offering to make it more attractive and lucrative for potential franchisees.",
                        "Enter the dynamic duo of Evocalize and local digital marketing \u2013 a game-changing combination that\u2019s redefining the attractiveness of franchise opportunities.",
                        "In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the nuts and bolts of why robust and localized digital marketing strategies are no longer just a \u2018good-to-have\u2019, but a \u2018must-have\u2019 in enhancing your franchise offerings. It\u2019s about creating a harmonious blend of global branding and local relevance \u2013 a strategy that not only resonates with potential franchise owners but also with the end consumers they aim to attract.",
                        "",
                        "In the bustling marketplace of franchise opportunities, what sets a franchise apart isn\u2019t just its business model or brand recognition; it\u2019s the overall attractiveness of its offering to potential franchisees. This attractiveness hinges on a multitude of factors, from financial return and growth potential to support systems and marketing prowess.",
                        "Let\u2019s face it, when someone decides to invest in a franchise, they\u2019re not just buying into a business; they\u2019re buying into a dream \u2013 a dream of success, independence, and growth. This dream becomes more tangible when they can see the real value behind what\u2019s being offered. The key to enhance franchise offering? A well-orchestrated digital marketing strategy that connects with the local community, yet ties back to the strength of a well-known brand.",
                        "In today\u2019s digital-first world, the ability of a franchise to offer comprehensive and localized marketing support is more than an added bonus. Prospective franchisees are increasingly savvy about the need for a strong digital presence, one that reaches the right audience with the right message at the right time. They are looking for evidence that the franchisor understands not only the broad strokes of marketing but also the nuances of local engagement.",
                        "Why? Because local engagement drives business. A staggering 88% of local searches on a mobile device results in a visit to the business or a phone call within 24 hours.",
                        "A franchise that excels in resonating with its local community stands a higher chance of success. Potential franchisees know this. They are on the lookout for franchisors who offer not just a name and a product, but a path to forging meaningful connections with local customers. This is where the real magic to enhance franchise offering lies.",
                        "",
                        "While the franchise model offers numerous advantages, it comes with its own set of complexities, many of which center around maintaining brand consistency and effectively managing local marketing efforts.",
                        "Understanding the dual nature of franchise marketing",
                        "The first hurdle to enhance franchise offering is understanding and managing the dual nature of franchise marketing. On one hand, there\u2019s a need to uphold the franchisor\u2019s brand identity and values across all locations. This uniformity is what gives the franchise its strength and recognition. On the other hand, each franchisee operates in a unique local market with its own preferences and competitors. Herein lies the challenge: How does one maintain this delicate balance between global brand consistency and local market relevance?",
                        "Localization vs. brand consistency",
                        "A common pitfall for many franchises is either leaning too much towards centralization, thus stifling local innovation and relevance, or allowing too much localization, leading to a diluted or inconsistent brand image. Potential franchisees are often wary of these extremes. They seek a franchise that offers the support and strength of a well-established brand, yet allows enough flexibility to adapt and thrive in their local markets. To enhance franchise offering, therefore, means finding the sweet spot where brand consistency harmonizes with local customization.",
                        "This is where the role of digital marketing, particularly local digital marketing, becomes pivotal. Traditional marketing methods often fall short in addressing these unique challenges. However, digital marketing, with its inherent flexibility and capacity for personalization, presents an opportunity to enhance franchise offering significantly.",
                        "A sophisticated digital marketing strategy, empowered by platforms like Evocalize, can help franchises deploy localized campaigns that resonate with local audiences while ensuring that all marketing efforts align with the overarching brand message. This approach not only enhances the appeal of the franchise but also empowers franchisees to feel more in control of their success, knowing they have the tools to effectively engage their local market.",
                        "Evocalize\u2019s platform is designed with the unique needs of franchises in mind. It recognizes the challenge of maintaining brand consistency while also catering to local market nuances. The platform provides a suite of tools that enable franchises to create and implement digital marketing strategies that resonate locally, yet align with the brand\u2019s global message.",
                        "This seamless integration is crucial to enhance franchise offering, as it provides potential franchisees with the assurance that they can effectively market to their local audience without compromising the brand\u2019s integrity.",
                        "Advanced targeting capabilities",
                        "Evocalize offers precise targeting tools, allowing franchises to reach specific demographics and local markets.",

                        "Pre-designed campaign templates maintain brand integrity while allowing for local customization.",
                        "Comprehensive data analytics and reporting",
                        "Real-time analytics provide insights into campaign performance, customer behavior, and market trends.",
                        "Collaborative marketing infrastructure",
                        "A platform designed for collaboration between the franchisor, franchisees, and other stakeholders.",

                        "Evocalize integrates with major digital platforms like Google, Facebook, and Instagram, streamlining campaign execution.",

                        "Evocalize provides an intuitive interface, making it accessible for users with varying levels of marketing expertise.",
                        "With all of the changes happening with digital marketing, the ability to adapt quickly is crucial for continued success. Consumer preferences change, new platforms emerge, and competitors ramp up their digital game. Franchises that offer the agility to keep pace with these changes have a leg up.",
                        "This is where Evocalize truly shines in making franchises future-ready. With continuous product innovation, Evocalize ensures that its platform has the most cutting-edge capabilities to execute digital marketing strategies that evolve with the times.",
                        "Some key advantages that Evocalize provides to make franchises future-proof (and enhance franchise offering):",
                        "Agility and continuous innovation are baked into Evocalize\u2019s DNA.

                        "In an increasingly noisy marketplace, standing out as a franchise means striking the right chord \u2013 one that hums with brand consistency yet resonates locally.
