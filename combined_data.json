            "Don\u2019t you wish your marketing could have an immediate impact ON REVENUE at the location level?  That's why we created a magic button that automates digital ads on Google, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube that does exactly that.\n\nPicture this with me: It\u2019s Wednesday afternoon in your Denver location and weekly sales are trending low. No problem, your pre-approved awareness ad on Google just goes live and you didn\u2019t even have to push \u201cgo\u201d. \nIn fact, you didn\u2019t even need to know sales were off track. Your POS knew and it triggered the ad you created weeks ago inside of the budget you set. Voila...you've got foot traffic. \n\n\u2026 All this while you were getting a coffee.\n\nNot magic enough?\n\nWe can automate any ads or programs based off any business data, and give you and your franchisees visibility into where the marketing dollars are spent. And, we even give franchisees tools to manually launch their own ads in minutes, so they can hit their goals without a marketing background."

            "We were the first to commercialize the virtual office space, back in 1995. Entrepreneurs with businesses of all sizes were able to leverage flexible office leases to focus and do their best work.\n\nOver 25 years later, the landscape has changed. We\u2019ve reimagined flexible office space to support the modern business owner. While today\u2019s competition may offer office space, we provide productive environments, created to impress clients and provide the professional support to get things done.\n\nWho is the modern business owner? This is a person who is smart, efficient, and driven to succeed in life and business. What they do is often an expression of who they are. At any stage of their company\u2019s lifecycle, they are pulled in a thousand directions, and they want to focus on what they deem most important (and wish the rest could take care of itself).\n\nIf this sounds like you, you\u2019ll find a home here."

            "The scarcity of affordable, skilled workers has become a bottleneck for franchise growth, crippling the ability to provide support to franchisees and dramatically increasing labor costs.

Senior leadership within franchise brands need a solution that turns the current labor market into a strategic advantage. DOXA\u00ae Talent has deep experience helping companies expand their business and build global teams across multiple continents. We\u2019ve harnessed our understanding of both franchising and outsourcing to develop a better offshoring solution for franchisors: Franchise Talent. This provides access to highly-skilled, international talent for franchisors, franchisees, FSOs, franchise aligned businesses that empowers domestic teams and supercharges growth."
